# Automatic-Box-Garden

This Box Garden is meant to monitor growing conditions for growing plants indoors.

Every 30 minutes the program reads a light, moisture, and temperature sensor, and will turn on a light or watering system as necessary.
There is also a LCD display that shows what the senors are reading.

The code also has a pump override to toggle the pump on and off if needed.
